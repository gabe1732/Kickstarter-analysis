### Purpose
the purpose of the Project was to determine what kind of fund raisiers were the most successful and what would be the best time of the year to launch these projects. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The most successful projects were started in May with a goal less than $5,000.00.  Theater had the largest amount of successful kickstart out of all of the categories. the largest pledge was for 3Doodler: The Worlds First 3D printing pen. Some of the challenges faced was based on the accuracy of the data. Some kickstarts had a goal of 1.00 so we truely do not know if those were truly a success or fail based on the low goal.
