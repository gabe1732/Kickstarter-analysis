# An Analysis of Kicksarter Campaigns

##Overview of Project
Performing analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends within the projects. The project was an analysis of data from over 4,000 fund raising projects over 9 years. The data consisted of successful, failed, canceled and live perfromances of projects ranging from films and videos to live theater. 

### Purpose
the purpose of the Project was to determine what kind of fund raisiers were the most successful and what would be the best time of the year to launch these projects. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The most successful projects were started in May with a goal less than $5,000.00.  Theater had the largest amount of successful kickstart out of all of the categories. the largest pledge was for 3Doodler: The Worlds First 3D printing pen. Some of the challenges faced was based on the accuracy of the data. Some kickstarts had a goal of 1.00 so we truely do not know if those were truly a success or fail based on the low goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The greatest challenge was converting the dates to readable dates. Also seperating the Categories and Subcategories.  

## Results
- The most successful projects were Thearter productions.  Their level of success greatly increased if they were launched in the month of May. 
- Pledge goals less than $5000.00 tend to be the most successful.  While goals greater than $45,000.00 do not tend to succeed often.
- One of the biggest limitation of this dataset it does not include the cost of the individual projects.  If cost was included we can also determine the most profitable projects by unit.  
- Some other tables that could be helpful are tables looking at the length of the particular projects to determine how successful project last vs unsuccessful projects.
